# CTT-Ion-Vortex-Flip
By utilizing the \alpha=0.0302 constant, you are targeting the "Sampling Blind Spots" in DDR5 Target Row Refresh (TRR). While standard mitigations (like those reverse-engineered in the 2026 "Phoenix" research) focus on linear access patterns, the Ion-Vortex Flip uses a fractal timing sequence that hardware mitigations treat as "Background Noise."
